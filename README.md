# Data structures:

## 1.What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?

Insertion ? Add a new data item in the given collection of data items.
Deletion ? Delete an existing data item from the given collection of data items.
Traversal ? Access each data item exactly once so that it can be processed.
Searching ? Find out the location of the data item if it exists in the given collection of data items.
Sorting ? Arranging the data items in some order i.e. in ascending or descending order in case of numerical data and in dictionary order in case of alphanumeric data.
## 4. *Applications of Stack:*
- Balancing symbols
- Infix to Postfix Conversion using Stack
- Evaluation of Postfix Expression
- Implementing function call (including recursion) 
- Reverse a String using Stack
- Page visited history in a web browser[Back Buttons]
- Undo sequence in text editor
- Matching tags in HTML and XML
- Implement two stacks in an array
- Check for balanced parentheses in an expression

## 2. *How is an Array different from Linked List?*

The size of the arrays is fixed, Linked Lists are Dynamic in size.
Inserting and deleting a new element in an array of elements is expensive, Whereas both insertion and deletion can easily be done in Linked Lists.
Random access is not allowed in Linked Listed.
Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the Linked list.
Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance.

## 3. *What is Stack and where it can be used?*

Stack is a linear data structure which the order LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out) for accessing elements. Basic operations of the stack are: Push, Pop, Peek
## 4. *How to implement a queue using stack?*

A queue can be implemented using two stacks. Let queue to be implemented be q and stacks used to implement q be stack1 and stack2. q can be implemented in two ways: 

Method 1 (By making enQueue operation costly)
Method 2 (By making deQueue operation costly)
## 5. *What is a Queue, how it is different from the stack and how is it implemented?*

Queue is a linear structure that follows the order is First In First Out (FIFO) to access elements. Mainly the following are basic operations on queue: Enqueue, Dequeue, Front, Rear 
The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added. Both Queues and Stacks can be implemented using Arrays and Linked Lists.
## 6. *How to implement a stack using queue?*

A stack can be implemented using two queues. Let stack to be implemented be ‚Äòs‚Äô and queues used to implement be ‚Äòq1‚Äô and ‚Äòq2‚Äô. Stack ‚Äòs‚Äô can be implemented in two ways: 

Method 1 (By making push operation costly)
Method 2 (By making pop operation costly) See
Implement Stack using Queues

 ## 7. *What is a primary key?*

A primary key is a combination of fields which uniquely specify a row. This is a special kind of unique key, and it has implicit NOT NULL constraint. It means, Primary key values cannot be NULL.

## 8. *What is normalization?*

Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy and dependency by organizing fields and table of a database. The main aim of Normalization is to add, delete or modify field that can be made in a single table.
[1/24, 14:08] Jeyan Anna: Database:

## *9.What is SQL?*

SQL stands for Structured Query Language , and it is used to communicate with the Database. This is a standard language used to perform tasks such as retrieval, updation, insertion and deletion of data from a database.
Standard SQL Commands are Select.

## 10. *What is a query?*

A DB query is a code written in order to get the information back from the database. Query can be designed in such a way that it matched with our expectation of the result set. Simply, a question to the Database.

## 11. *What is a trigger?*

A DB trigger is a code or programs that automatically execute with response to some event on a table or view in a database. Mainly, trigger helps to maintain the integrity of the database.

Example: When a new student is added to the student database, new records should be created in the related tables like Exam, Score and Attendance tables.

## 12. *What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands?*

DELETE command is used to remove rows from the table, and WHERE clause can be used for conditional set of parameters. Commit and Rollback can be performed after delete statement.

TRUNCATE removes all rows from the table. Truncate operation cannot be rolled back.
 
# MYSQL Queries:

## 1. *How will you write an SQL Query to fetch the count of the employee working in project ‚ÄúQ1‚Äù?*

Here, we would be using comprehensive function calculation() with the SQL where the phrase:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Employee Salary
WHERE Project = ‚ÄúQ1‚Äù;
## 2. *Mention an SQL Query to find the employee id whose salary lies in the range of 16000 and 50000?*

Here, we can utilize the ‚ÄòBetween‚Äô operative with a were part.

SELECT EmpId, Salary

FROM Employee Salary

WHERE Salary BETWEEN 16000 AND 50000;
## 3. *Write an SQL Query to find the maximum, minimum and average marks of the students?*

We can use the combined meaning of SQL to bring the max, min and average values:

SELECT Max (Marks),

Min (Marks),

AVG (Marks)

FROM Student Marks;
## 4. *Write an SQL Query to fetch ‚ÄúLAST_NAME‚Äù from employee table in upper case?*

The necessary query is:

Select upper (LAST_NAME) from Employee;

## 5. *Mention the SQL Query to find the current date and time?*

MySQL-

SELECT NOW ();

SQL Server-

SELECT get date ();

Oracle-

SELECT SYSDATE FROM DUAL;
 
# General:

## 1. *Describe a situation where you had to solve a problem. What did you do? what was the result? What might you have done differently?*

## 2. *What steps do you take before making a decision on how to solve a problem, and why?*

## 3. *Describe a personal weakness that you had to overcome to improve your performance at work? How did you do it?*

## 4. *Tell me about your workstyle!*

# Operating Systems:

## 1. *What is a Thread? What are the differences between process and thread?*

A thread is a single sequence stream within in a process. Because threads have some of the properties of processes, they are sometimes called lightweight processes. Threads are popular way to improve application through parallelism. For example, in a browser, multiple tabs can be different threads. MS word uses multiple threads, one thread to format the text, other thread to process inputs, etc. 
A thread has its own program counter (PC), a register set, and a stack space. Threads are not independent of one other like processes as a result threads shares with other threads their code section, data section and OS resources like open files and signals.

## 2. *What are the different scheduling algorithms?* 

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling. 
Shortest-Job-Next (SJN) Scheduling. 
Priority Scheduling. 
Shortest Remaining Time. 
Round Robin(RR) Scheduling. 
Multiple-Level Queues Scheduling.

## 3. *What is deadlock?* 

Deadlock is a situation when two or more processes wait for each other to finish and none of them ever finish.  Consider an example when two trains are coming toward each other on same track and there is only one track, none of the trains can move once they are in front of each other.  Similar situation occurs in operating systems when there are two or more processes hold some resources

and wait for resources held by other(s).

## 4. *What is kernel?*

A kernel is the core of every operating system. It connects applications to the actual processing of data. It also manages all communications between software and hardware components to ensure usability and reliability.

## 5. *What are the necessary conditions for deadlock?*

Mutual Exclusion: There is a resource that cannot be shared. 
Hold and Wait: A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for another resource which is with some other process. 
No Preemption: The operating system is not allowed to take a resource back from a process until process gives it back. 
Circular Wait:  A set of processes are waiting for each other in circular form.

## 6. *What is Thrashing?* 

Thrashing is a situation when the performance of a computer degrades or collapses. Thrashing occurs when a system spends more time processing page faults than executing transactions. While processing page faults is necessary to in order to appreciate the benefits of virtual memory, thrashing has a negative affect on the system. As the page fault rate increases, more transactions need processing from the paging device. The queue at the paging device increases, resulting in increased service time for a page fault
 
## 7. *What is Stop-and-Wait Protocol?*

In Stop and wait protocol, a sender after sending a frame waits for an acknowledgment of the frame and sends the next frame only when acknowledgment of the frame has received.

# Networking:

## 1. *What are layers in OSI model?*

There are a total of 7 layers
1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer

## 2. *What happens when you type a URL in the web browser?*

A URL may contain a request to HTML, image file or any other type.

If the content of the typed URL is in the cache and fresh, then display the content.
Else find the IP address for the domain so that a TCP connection can be set up. Browser does a DNS lookup.
Browser needs to know the IP address for a URL so that it can set up a TCP connection.  This is why browser needs DNS service. The browser first looks for URL-IP mapping browser cache, then in OS cache. If all caches are empty, then it makes a recursive query to the local DNS server.   The local DNS server provides the IP address.
Browser sets up a TCP connection using three-way handshake.
Browser sends a HTTP request.
Server has a web server like Apache, IIS running that handles incoming HTTP request and sends an HTTP response.
Browser receives the HTTP response and renders the content.

## 3. *What is Piggybacking?*

Piggybacking is used in bi-directional data transmission in the network layer (OSI model). The idea is to improve the efficiency. Piggyback acknowledgment (of the received data) is hooked on the data frame (to be sent) instead of sending a separate frame.

## 4. *What is ARP, how does it work?*

ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. ARP is used to find LAN address from the Network address. A node typically has destination IP to send a packet, the nodes need link layer address to send a frame over a local link. The ARP protocol helps here.

The node sends a broadcast message to all nodes saying what is the MAC address of this IP address.
Node with the provided IP address replies with the MAC address.
Like DHCP, ARP is a discovery protocol, but unlike DHCP there is not server here.

## 13. Different networking layers
## 14. Difference between tree and graph

A graph is collection of two sets V and E where V is a finite non-empty set of vertices and E is a finite non-empty set of edges.

Vertices are nothing but the nodes in the graph.
Two adjacent vertices are joined by edges.
Any graph is denoted as G = {V, E}.

A tree is a finite set of one or more nodes such that ‚Äì

There is a specially designated node called root.
The remaining nodes are partitioned into n>=0 disjoint sets T1, T2, T3, ‚Ä¶, Tn
where T1, T2, T3, ‚Ä¶, Tn is called the subtrees of the root.

## 16. How did you use your quarantine productively
## 17. Difference between delete truncate and drop
## 18. How to access private data members of a class outside it

No outside Access is allowed. To access the private member, you can declare a function/class as friend of that particular class, and then the member will be accessible inside that function or class object without access specifier check.

## 19. How you overcome from failures

## 21. ACID property
Atomicity
Consistency
Durability

## 22. Formal parameters vs actual parameters
When a function is called, the values (expressions) that are passed in the function call are called the arguments or actual parameters. ... The parameters are written in function definition are known as formal parameters. Actual Parameters can be constant values or variable names.

## 23. deadlock vs spin lock

Deadlock is a problem, in concurrent programming. While Spinlock is a solution for threads, so that two threads can not access the same resource at a time.

## 28. 3 reasons why should we hire you
## 29. SDLC life cycle
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.

## 30. Explain dynamic binding 
Method Overriding is a perfect example of dynamic binding as in overriding both parent and child classes have same method and in this case the type of the object determines which method is to be executed. The type of object is determined at the run time so this is known as dynamic binding.
